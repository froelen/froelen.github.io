# froelen.github.io

Hi! This website was created and is managed and maintaned by me (froelen) :)

It is shared source, so that other people can easily access the code behind it.

If you fork it and do a pull request, unless it addresses something that i really need, or is about privacy / security / accessibility AND is coherent with the current state of the website, I probably won't merge it.

Feel free to read, test things, fork it, and take parts of this code for your own project, although I'd appreciate you crediting me if what you end up using it (whether it is raw code or inspiration).
